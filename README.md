# Big-Data-Assignment-MapReduce-Paradigm-
Problem Statement 
1).Use Hadoop’s implementation of MapReduce to find the average of each user’s movie ratings in the dataset (program refernce Average.java)   
2).create the MapReduce methods that count the number of times a rating was submitted for a specific date(program reference Rating.java)


#THE PROBE DATASET FILE DESCRIPTION
To allow you to test your system before you submit a prediction set based on the
qualifying dataset, we have provided a probe dataset in the file "probe.txt".
This text file contains lines indicating a movie id, followed by a colon, and
then customer ids, one per line for that movie id.

MovieID1:
CustomerID11
CustomerID12
...
MovieID2:
CustomerID21
CustomerID22

Like the qualifying dataset, the movie and customer id pairs are contained in
the training set.  However, unlike the qualifying dataset, the ratings (and
dates) for each pair are contained in the training dataset.
